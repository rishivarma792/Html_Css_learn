<!-- 
->Combinators : 
 -> decendent combinators :  
 -> in this combinator the style is applied to all those inside 1st selector and and has 2nd selector even it 
    applies to those element which are not direct children 
  -> IMPORTANT : The way CSS actually applies styles is that it looks at each element,
   then goes through the stylesheets from top to bottom, decides if it matches, and 
   then applies/overrides styles as it goes. That’s just one aspect of the cascade, 
   among others (such as inheritance and specificity). Since in your second example #red
    span comes last in the CSS source, it gets applied last, overriding #green span, 
    regardless of “how close” the span is within the #red in the DOM.  
   ->it is beeter to target the a element directly with its class or id rather than combinators
